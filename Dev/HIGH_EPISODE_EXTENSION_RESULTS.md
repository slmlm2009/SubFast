# Test Results for High Episode Number Extension

## Fourth Test Run: High Episode Number Support (100+ and 1000+ episodes)

### Background
The original script had an issue where high episode numbers were incorrectly handled due to the use of `.zfill(2)` which would pad or truncate episode numbers to 2 digits. This caused episodes like 105 to become "05", leading to incorrect matches.

### Changes Made
Modified the `get_episode_number()` function in `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`:
- **Before**: Used `.zfill(2)` on episode numbers in both S##E## and "- ##" patterns
- **After**: Removed `.zfill(2)` from episode numbers while maintaining it for season numbers (2-digit padding)
- **Result**: Preserves original episode number digits while maintaining 2-digit season format

### Test Cases Conducted

#### Test 1: Basic High Episode (105)
- **Files**: `show.S01E105.mkv` and `subtitle - 105.srt`
- **Result**: Successfully matched and renamed to `show.S01E105.ar.srt`
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Test 2: Mixed Low/High Episodes 
- **Files**: `show.S01E05.mkv`, `show.S01E105.mkv`, `subtitle - 05.srt`, `another - 105.ass`
- **Result**: 
  - `subtitle - 05.srt` → `show.S01E05.ar.srt` (episode 5)
  - `another - 105.ass` → `show.S01E105.ar.ass` (episode 105)
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (No confusion between low and high numbers)

#### Test 3: Four-Digit Episodes (1000+)
- **Files**: `show.S01E1005.mkv` and `subtitle.S01E1005.srt`
- **Result**: Successfully matched and renamed to `show.S01E1005.ar.srt`
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Test 4: Comprehensive Mixed Test
- **Files**: Multiple S##E## and "- ##" patterns with episodes 1, 105, 200, and 1005
- **Result**: All episodes correctly matched to corresponding subtitles:
  - Episode 01: `subtitle - 01.srt` → `show.S01E01.ar.srt`
  - Episode 105: `other - 105.ass` → `show.S01E105.ar.ass`
  - Episode 200: `different.S01E200.srt` → `another.show - 200.ar.srt`
  - Episode 1005: `another.S01E1005.ass` → `third.show.S01E1005.ar.ass`
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Test 5: Backward Compatibility
- **Verification**: Re-ran original mixed patterns test
- **Result**: All original functionality preserved, previous patterns still work correctly
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Key Improvements

1. **High Episode Support**: Episodes 100+ and 1000+ are now handled correctly
2. **No Number Confusion**: Episode 5 and 105 are no longer confused due to same padded value
3. **Preserved Season Format**: Seasons still use 2-digit padding (S01, S02, etc.)
4. **Mixed Pattern Compatibility**: Works with both S##E## and "- ##" patterns
5. **Full Backward Compatibility**: All original functionality maintained

### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: `.zfill(2)` on episode numbers was causing "105" → "05"
- **Fix Applied**: Removed `.zfill(2)` from episode part of both pattern matchers
- **Season Handling**: Kept `.zfill(2)` for season to maintain consistent format
- **Matching Logic**: Dictionary-based matching now works with actual episode numbers

### Verification of Original Functionality Preservation

- ✅ S##E## pattern matching continues to work
- ✅ "- ##" pattern matching continues to work  
- ✅ Mixed pattern matching continues to work
- ✅ Movie matching functionality continues to work
- ✅ No-match cases continue to be handled correctly
- ✅ Multiple file scenarios continue to work as expected

### Conclusion

The extension successfully adds support for high episode numbers (100+) and thousands of episodes while maintaining complete backward compatibility with existing functionality. The script now properly handles shows with extensive episode counts without any risk of episode number confusion.
