# Implementation Results: E1234 and Year-Based Movie Patterns

## Patterns Successfully Implemented

### 1. E1234 Pattern (Enhanced Episode Detection)
- **Pattern**: `Show.Name.E1234.mkv` and `subtitle.E1234.srt`
- **Regex**: `(?:^|[._\s-])[Ee](\d{2,})(?=[._\s-]|$)`
- **Logic**: Matches E followed by 2+ digits when separated by word boundaries
- **Result**: Episode 1234 is detected as S01E1234 and matched appropriately

#### Test Results:
- ✅ `Show.Name.E1234.mkv` + `subtitle.E1234.srt` → Correctly matched
- ✅ Differentiated from non-episode patterns like "Title.2023"
- ✅ Works with other patterns simultaneously

### 2. Year-Based Movie Matching (Enhanced Movie Detection)
- **Pattern**: `Movie.Title.2023.mkv` and `Movie.Title.2023.srt`
- **Logic**: When exactly one video and one subtitle exist, prioritize matches with same year
- **Enhancement**: Year matching takes priority in movie detection scenarios
- **Result**: Better disambiguation for movie files with years

#### Test Results:
- ✅ Single movie with year: `Movie.Title.2023.mkv` + `Movie.Title.2023.srt` → Matched correctly
- ✅ Regular movie matching still works: `The.Big.Movie.Title.mkv` + `The.Big.Movie.Title.srt` → Matched correctly
- ✅ Year matching prioritized when present

## All Functionality Preserved

✅ **S##E## episodes**: Continue to work as before
✅ **- ## patterns**: Continue to work as before  
✅ **High episode numbers**: 100+ and 1000+ episodes continue to work
✅ **No-season patterns**: Show.Name - 1234 continue to work
✅ **Mixed patterns**: All patterns work together
✅ **Movie functionality**: Original movie matching preserved

## Technical Improvements

1. **E Pattern Safety**: Used word boundaries to avoid false matches like "Title.2023"
2. **Year Detection**: Added year extraction with regex `(?:19|20)\d{2}`
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All original functionality maintained
4. **Performance**: No performance impact, only added new pattern detection

## Files Successfully Renamed in Tests:

- Show.S01E01.ar.srt (S##E## pattern)
- Show.E101.ar.ass (E#### pattern)  
- Show.Name - 201.ar.srt (Show - ## pattern)
- Movie.Title.2023.ar.srt (Year-based movie pattern)

## Summary

Both requested patterns have been successfully implemented without breaking any existing functionality:
- The E1234 pattern now works for files like "Show.Name.E1234"
- Year-based movie matching prioritizes matches when both files have the same year
- All existing functionality remains intact and operational
