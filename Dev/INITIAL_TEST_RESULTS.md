# Test Results for Subtitle Renaming Script

## Initial Test Run

### Test Environment
- Windows 10/11 environment
- Python 3.13 installed
- Test directory: `test_directory`
- Test files created:
  - Video files: `show.S01E01.mkv`, `show.S01E02.mkv`, `another.show.S02E05.mp4`
  - Subtitle files: `subtitle.S01E01.srt`, `other.S01E02.ass`, `different - 05.srt`

### Test Execution
Ran the script with the command: `python rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py`

### Issues Found

1. **Unicode Character Issue**
   - **Problem**: The script contained a Unicode arrow character `→` in the print statement which caused a `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows
   - **Location**: Line 52 in the print statement `print(f"Renaming: {subtitle} → {new_name}")`
   - **Solution**: Changed the arrow to `->` (regular ASCII characters)
   - **Result**: Fixed and script ran successfully

2. **Input Function Issue**
   - **Problem**: The script had an `input("Press any key to exit...")` line that caused an `EOFError` when run from command line
   - **Location**: Last line of the script
   - **Result**: This caused a non-zero exit code but didn't affect the core functionality

### Actual Results
The script executed and successfully:
- Detected 3 video files: `another.show.S02E05.mp4`, `show.S01E01.mkv`, `show.S01E02.mkv`
- Detected 3 subtitle files: `different - 05.srt`, `other.S01E02.ass`, `subtitle.S01E01.srt`
- Correctly identified video episodes: `S02E05`, `S01E01`, `S01E02`
- Processed subtitle `different - 05.srt`, detected episode `S01E05`
- Correctly identified that there was no matching video for episode `S01E05` (since `another.show.S02E05.mp4` is S02E05, not S01E05)
- Successfully renamed `other.S01E02.ass` to `show.S01E02.ar.ass` (matched with `show.S01E02.mkv`)
- Successfully renamed `subtitle.S01E01.srt` to `show.S01E01.ar.srt` (matched with `show.S01E01.mkv`)
- Completed with message "Renaming complete! 2 files renamed."

### Expected vs Actual Results
- Expected: 2 files to be renamed based on matching episode numbers (S01E01 and S01E02)
- Actual: 2 files were renamed correctly
- Verification: 
  - ✅ `subtitle.S01E01.srt` → `show.S01E01.ar.srt` (Correct match)
  - ✅ `other.S01E02.ass` → `show.S01E02.ar.ass` (Correct match)
  - ✅ `different - 05.srt` was not renamed (Correct, no matching S01E05 video)
  - ❌ `another.show.S02E05.mp4` had no matching subtitle (Expected behavior)

### Issues to Address
1. The Unicode arrow character in print statements causes encoding errors on Windows
2. The input() function at the end causes issues when running from automated environments
3. The `- ##` pattern matching worked correctly - it detected `different - 05.srt` as S01E05, but correctly identified there was no matching S01E05 video file (only S02E05 existed)

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Episode detection worked correctly for both S##E## and - ## patterns
- ✅ File renaming worked correctly
- ✅ Appropriate console output was provided
- ✅ Non-matching files remained unchanged
- ✅ Correct number of files renamed (2 out of 3 subtitles matched videos)

### Additional Notes
- The `- ##` pattern detection worked as expected, converting `different - 05.srt` to episode `S01E05`
- The script correctly identified that there was no matching video file for S01E05 when only S02E05 existed
- Zero-padding worked correctly (episode "5" was converted to "05")
- Both .srt and .ass subtitle formats were handled correctly
- Both .mkv and .mp4 video formats were detected correctly
