# Fixes Applied to Integration Testing

## Issue 1: Summary at Top + List Failed Variations ✅ FIXED

### Changes:
1. **Moved SUMMARY to top of report file** (not at end)
2. **Changed "FINAL SUMMARY" to "SUMMARY"**
3. **Added "FAILED VARIATIONS" section** listing specific patterns/VARs that failed

### Implementation:
- Added `build_report()` method that constructs report with summary first
- Summary now shows at top with header "SUMMARY" (not "FINAL SUMMARY")
- Failed variations listed with specific pattern/VAR details

---

## Issue 2: Better Error Messages for Pattern Mismatches ✅ FIXED

### Problem:
When subtitle couldn't be matched, report said "NOT FOUND" but file actually exists - just couldn't extract pattern or pair.

### Solution:
Now distinguishes between:
- **File exists but NOT in CSV** - Pattern didn't match or couldn't pair
- **File NOT FOUND on disk** - File actually missing

### New Messages:
```
[FAIL] Not found in CSV report (files may not have paired or pattern didn't match)
  Video:    EXISTS but NOT in report - Pattern may not have matched expected S01E05
  Subtitle: EXISTS but NOT in report - Pattern may not have matched expected S01E05
```

OR

```
  Video:    FILE NOT FOUND on disk
  Subtitle: FILE NOT FOUND on disk
```

## Issue 3: Integration with run_tests.py ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL INTEGRATION

### What Needs to Be Done:

The integration test runner (`run_pattern_integration_tests.py`) needs to be called from `run_tests.py` as part of the main test suite.

### Recommended Approach:

**Option A: Call as Subprocess (Simplest)**

Add to `run_tests.py` after unittest tests:

```python
def run_integration_tests():
    """Run pattern integration tests."""
    import subprocess
    
    integration_script = Path(__file__).parent / 'run_pattern_integration_tests.py'
    
    print()
    print("=" * 100)
    print("RUNNING PATTERN INTEGRATION TESTS")
    print("=" * 100)
    print()
    
    result = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, str(integration_script)],
        capture_output=False  # Show output directly
    )
    
    return result.returncode

# Then call it in main():
def main():
    # ... existing unittest code ...
    
    # Run integration tests
    integration_exit_code = run_integration_tests()
    
    # Combined exit code
    sys.exit(max(exit_code, integration_exit_code))
```

**Option B: Import and Run Directly**

```python
from run_pattern_integration_tests import IntegrationTestRunner

def main():
    # ... existing unittest code ...
    
    # Run integration tests
    print()
    print("=" * 100)
    print("RUNNING PATTERN INTEGRATION TESTS")
    print("=" * 100)
    
    runner = IntegrationTestRunner()
    integration_exit = runner.run_all_patterns()
    
    # Combined exit code
    sys.exit(max(exit_code, integration_exit))
```

### Report Integration:

The integration test already saves its own report to `tests/reports/integration-test-TIMESTAMP.txt`.

The existing unittest report goes to `tests/reports/test-results-TIMESTAMP.txt`.

Both reports are preserved in `tests/reports/` directory.

---

## Summary of All Fixes:

### ✅ Fixed:
1. Summary now at TOP of report (not bottom)
2. "FINAL SUMMARY" changed to "SUMMARY"
3. Failed variations listed with specific pattern/VAR details
4. Better error messages distinguishing file existence vs pattern mismatch
5. CSV report parser updated to handle text-based format
6. Backup/restore mechanism working correctly
7. Reset script preserves reports

### ⚠️ Manual Step Required:
- Integration with `run_tests.py` needs to be added (see Option A or B above)

---

## Testing the Fixes:

### Test Summary at Top:
```bash
python tests/run_pattern_integration_tests.py --pattern 1
cat tests/reports/integration-test-*.txt | head -30
```

Should show SUMMARY at top, not bottom.

### Test Better Error Messages:
```bash
# Modify a subtitle file in pattern_21 folder
cd tests/fixtures/pattern_files/pattern_21_Season_.Ep
# Rename [VAR1] subtitle to break pattern
mv "[VAR1]-Show.Season 1.Ep 5.srt" "[VAR1]-RandomName.srt"

# Run test
cd ../../../../
python tests/run_pattern_integration_tests.py --pattern 21
```

Should show:
```
  Video:    EXISTS but NOT in report - Pattern may not have matched expected S01E05
  Subtitle: EXISTS but NOT in report - Pattern may not have matched expected S01E05
```

### Reset and verify:
```bash
python tests/reset_test_files.py
```

Should preserve reports in tests/reports/.

---

## Next Steps:

1. Choose integration approach (Option A or B)
2. Edit `tests/run_tests.py` to add integration test runner
3. Test combined test suite:
   ```bash
   python tests/run_tests.py
   ```
4. Verify both reports are generated in `tests/reports/`
