This directory contains the output from the **real embedding integration tests**.

## Files

### `embedded_Show - Episode 2.mkv`

**Generated by**: `test_embedding_integration.py::TestEmbeddingWorkflowWithMkvmerge::test_basic_mkvmerge_syntax`

**Description**: This is a real MKV video file with an embedded subtitle track, created during integration testing.

**Tracks**:
- Track 0: Video (AV1)
- Track 1: Audio (AAC)
- **Track 2: Subtitles (SubRip/SRT)** ✅ Embedded during test

**Source Files**:
- Video: `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/Show - Episode 2.mkv` (26.6 MB)
- Subtitle: `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/Demo Show Ep1.srt` (245 bytes)

**Purpose**: This file proves that the integration tests perform **actual embedding** using mkvmerge, not just mocking.

## Verifying the Embedding

You can verify the subtitle was embedded using mkvmerge:

```bash
# Check track information
mkvmerge -i "embedded_Show - Episode 2.mkv"

# Expected output:
# Track ID 0: video (AV1)
# Track ID 1: audio (AAC)
# Track ID 2: subtitles (SubRip/SRT)  ← Embedded subtitle!
```

Or play the video in a media player that supports MKV subtitles (VLC, MPC-HC, etc.) and enable the subtitle track.

## Note

- This directory is **gitignored** - embedded files are not committed to the repository
- Files here are regenerated each time the embedding integration tests run
- Original test files remain in `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/`
