# Next Steps

## For Development Team

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Implement pattern recognition unit tests
2. Create manual test scenarios documentation
3. Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions
4. Document shared logic patterns used within both scripts

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Consider migrating to Python logging module for better debugging
2. Evaluate need for Windows Event Log integration
3. Research parallel embedding for multi-core systems

3. Review "Coding Standards" if contributing or modifying code
4. Use "Testing Strategy" for validating custom modifications

## For Architect

**This architecture is complete and production-ready.**

No additional architectural documents are required for SubFast as it has no:
- Frontend UI (no separate frontend architecture needed)
- Network API (no API specification needed)
- Cloud infrastructure (no IaC architecture needed)

All architectural concerns are covered in this unified document.
