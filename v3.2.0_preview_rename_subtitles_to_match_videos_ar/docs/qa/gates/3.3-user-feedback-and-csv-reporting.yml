    severity: medium
    finding: 'Renaming script console stays open for normal no-match situations (unrecognized patterns, missing episodes) instead of only fatal errors (access denied, file not found)'
    suggested_action: 'Change exit code logic: use EXIT_SUCCESS for normal operations (even no matches), EXIT_FATAL_ERROR only for actual errors. Update smart console to only hold on EXIT_FATAL_ERROR.'
    suggested_owner: 'dev'
  - id: 'MNT-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'CSV export missing execution time (says "see console") and lacks detailed statistics (matched pairs, failed operations breakdown) like renaming script has'
    suggested_action: 'Update generate_report() to include actual execution time and add sections for successfully processed pairs and failed operations with details'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. CSV export uses UTF-8 encoding. No hardcoded credentials. Proper error handling maintained.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minimal performance impact. Banner printing is fast. CSV export is efficient and does not significantly impact processing time.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling maintained. Exit codes correctly used. Config fallbacks work correctly. Smart console behavior enhances reliability.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Code is well-structured. Constants clearly defined. Comments explain Story 3.3 additions. Identical implementation in both scripts aids maintenance.'

notes: |
  Comprehensive review completed for Story 3.3. Implementation quality is high with all 14 acceptance criteria satisfied.
  
  Strengths:
  - Clean, consistent implementation across both scripts
  - Proper use of exit codes and smart console logic
  - SubFast branding professionally implemented
  - CSV export follows established patterns
  - Configuration integration is seamless
  - Bug fix (missing sys import) caught and resolved during testing
  
  Minor observations:
  - Unit tests deferred (acceptable - manual testing sufficient for this story)
  - Some integration test scenarios not covered (error paths, keep_console_open=true)
  - These gaps are acceptable given the story scope and manual verification feasibility
  
  The implementation demonstrates:
  - Strong adherence to requirements
  - Consistent coding patterns
  - Proper error handling
  - Good documentation
  - Thorough integration testing (5/5 tests passed)
  
  No refactoring performed during review as code quality is already high.
