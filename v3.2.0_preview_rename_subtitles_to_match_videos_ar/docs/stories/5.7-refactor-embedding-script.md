# Story 5.7: Refactor Embedding Script

**Epic:** 5 - Code Architecture Refactoring & Quality Improvements  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** P0  
**Completed:** January 2025

---

## Story

As a developer, I want the embedding script to use shared modules so that it's maintainable and follows DRY principles.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Configuration logic replaced with `config_loader.load_config()`
2. ✅ Pattern matching replaced with `pattern_engine.get_episode_number_cached()`
3. ✅ CSV reporting replaced with `csv_reporter.generate_csv_report()`
4. ✅ Language codes loaded from JSON file
5. ✅ All duplicated code removed
6. ✅ Only embedding-specific business logic retained
7. ✅ 100% feature parity with v3.0.0 maintained

---

## Implementation Summary

**Code Reduction:**
- Before: 1,798 lines
- After: ~480 lines
- Reduction: 73% (1,318 lines eliminated)

**Changes:**
- Replaced configuration parsing with shared module
- Replaced pattern detection with cached shared function
- Replaced CSV generation with shared reporter
- Load language codes from external JSON file
- Removed all duplicate utility functions
- Kept only embedding workflow logic

**Files Modified:**
- `subfast/scripts/subfast_embed.py` - Refactored to 480 lines

**Validation:**
- All v3.0.0 features working identically
- mkvmerge integration unchanged
- Backup workflow preserved (backups/ folder)
- Dynamic timeout working
- Enhanced CSV reports with accurate statistics

**Result:** Embedding script 73% smaller, cleaner, more maintainable, 100% feature compatible.
