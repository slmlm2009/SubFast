# Story 6.3: Integration Tests - Embedding Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** SubFast developer,  
**I want** integration tests using real video and subtitle files,  
**so that** the complete embedding workflow is validated end-to-end with realistic scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Integration tests use files from `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/`
2. Complete workflow tested (pattern match → embed → backup → cleanup)
3. Tests clean up after themselves (no leftover files)
4. Movie mode correctly tested (single video + subtitle matching)
5. mkvmerge availability gracefully handled (skip if not available)
6. Tests can run with or without mkvmerge installed
7. Backup creation workflow validated
8. Dynamic timeout calculation tested with different file sizes
9. Rollback behavior tested on failures
10. Error scenarios produce clear, actionable messages

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Set up integration test file management (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create `tests/test_embedding_integration.py`
  - [ ] Load real video/subtitle samples from `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/`
  - [ ] Create backup of original files before each test
  - [ ] Restore originals after each test (cleanup)
  - [ ] Use `setUp()` and `tearDown()` for file management
  - [ ] Verify no leftover files after test run

- [ ] Task 2: Test mkvmerge availability detection (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Test `check_mkvmerge_availability()` function
  - [ ] Handle case when mkvmerge is installed → Run full tests
  - [ ] Handle case when mkvmerge is NOT installed → Skip gracefully
  - [ ] Use `unittest.skipIf()` decorator for conditional tests
  - [ ] Provide clear skip reason: "mkvmerge not available"
  - [ ] Document how to install mkvmerge for full testing

- [ ] Task 3: Test video-subtitle pattern matching (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Test basic matching: video and subtitle with same episode pattern
  - [ ] Test case variations: S01E05 vs s01e05
  - [ ] Test pattern differences: video uses S01E05, subtitle uses 1x05
  - [ ] Test movie mode: single video + subtitle pair (no episode numbers)
  - [ ] Test multiple videos: ensure correct pairing
  - [ ] Test no match scenario: video without matching subtitle
  - [ ] Verify matched pairs contain correct (video, subtitle) files

- [ ] Task 4: Test embedding workflow (AC: 2, 7)
  - [ ] **Prerequisite:** mkvmerge must be available
  - [ ] Test complete embedding:
    - Input: video.mkv + subtitle.srt
    - Process: mkvmerge embeds subtitle
    - Output: video.mkv with embedded subtitle
    - Verify: original moved to backups/
  - [ ] Test backup directory creation: `backups/` folder created
  - [ ] Test backup file naming: timestamp + original name
  - [ ] Test subtitle removal: subtitle.srt deleted after embedding
  - [ ] Verify embedded file is valid (non-zero size)

- [ ] Task 5: Test dynamic timeout calculation (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Test timeout for small files (< 100MB) → Default timeout
  - [ ] Test timeout for large files (> 500MB) → Scaled timeout
  - [ ] Test timeout for very large files (> 1GB) → Maximum timeout
  - [ ] Verify timeout increases proportionally with file size
  - [ ] Test timeout is passed correctly to mkvmerge call

- [ ] Task 6: Test error scenarios and rollback (AC: 9, 10)
  - [ ] Test mkvmerge failure → Original files preserved
  - [ ] Test insufficient disk space → Clear error message
  - [ ] Test invalid video file → Graceful failure
  - [ ] Test invalid subtitle file → Graceful failure
  - [ ] Test permission error → Clear error message
  - [ ] Verify rollback: failed operation doesn't leave partial state
  - [ ] Test error messages are actionable (tell user what to fix)

- [ ] Task 7: Test batch processing integration (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Test multiple video/subtitle pairs processed sequentially
  - [ ] Test one failure doesn't stop batch (continues with next)
  - [ ] Test statistics tracking (success count, failure count)
  - [ ] Test CSV report generation after batch
  - [ ] Verify all results captured in report

- [ ] Task 8: Verify test cleanup and isolation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Run test suite → No files left in working directory
  - [ ] Run test suite twice → Second run starts with clean state
  - [ ] Verify backups/ folder cleaned up
  - [ ] Verify temporary files removed
  - [ ] Test isolation: tests don't affect each other

- [ ] Task 9: Create integration test utilities (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create helper: `backup_integration_files()` → Backs up samples
  - [ ] Create helper: `restore_integration_files()` → Restores originals
  - [ ] Create helper: `is_mkvmerge_available()` → Checks availability
  - [ ] Create helper: `get_sample_files()` → Returns test file paths
  - [ ] Add helpers to `tests/test_helpers.py` or local utilities

## Dev Notes

### Current System Context

**Integration Test Files:** `tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files/`
- Contains real video and subtitle samples
- Various file sizes for timeout testing
- Different episode patterns for matching tests

**Embedding Script:** `subfast/scripts/subfast_embed.py`
- Main workflow: match files → embed subtitles → backup → cleanup
- Uses `pattern_engine.py` for episode matching
- Uses `config_loader.py` for settings
- Uses `csv_reporter.py` for results

**Key Functions to Test:**
- Pattern matching between video/subtitle pairs
- mkvmerge execution with proper arguments
- Backup creation in `backups/` folder
- Dynamic timeout calculation
- Error handling and rollback

### Testing Standards

**Framework:** `unittest` (Python stdlib)

**Integration Test Structure:**
```python
import unittest
import shutil
from pathlib import Path
from subfast.scripts import subfast_embed

class TestEmbeddingIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    """Integration tests for embedding workflow."""
    
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        """Set up test environment once for all tests."""
        cls.test_files_dir = Path('tests/2- Embedding/integration_testing_files')
        cls.backup_dir = Path('tests/backups_temp')
        cls.backup_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        # Backup original test files
        cls._backup_test_files()
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up before each test."""
        # Restore files to original state before each test
        self._restore_test_files()
    
    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up after each test."""
        # Remove any generated files (backups/, etc.)
        self._cleanup_test_artifacts()
    
    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        """Clean up after all tests."""
        # Remove temporary backup directory
        shutil.rmtree(cls.backup_dir, ignore_errors=True)
    
    @unittest.skipIf(not is_mkvmerge_available(), "mkvmerge not installed")
    def test_basic_embedding(self):
        """Test basic subtitle embedding workflow."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    def test_pattern_matching(self):
        """Test video-subtitle pattern matching."""
        # This doesn't require mkvmerge
        pass
```

**Conditional Testing (mkvmerge):**
```python
def is_mkvmerge_available():
    """Check if mkvmerge is installed."""
    import shutil
    return shutil.which('mkvmerge') is not None

@unittest.skipIf(not is_mkvmerge_available(), "mkvmerge not installed")
def test_with_mkvmerge(self):
    """Test that requires mkvmerge."""
    pass
```

### Integration Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Basic Embedding**
- Input: `Show.S01E05.mkv` + `Show.S01E05.srt`
- Expected: Subtitle embedded, original backed up, srt deleted

**Scenario 2: Movie Mode**
- Input: `Movie.2024.mkv` + `Movie.2024.srt` (no episode numbers)
- Expected: Matched as movie pair, embedded successfully

**Scenario 3: Pattern Mismatch**
- Input: `Show.S01E05.mkv` + `Show.1x05.srt` (different patterns)
- Expected: Matched (both normalize to S01E05), embedded

**Scenario 4: No Match**
- Input: `Show.S01E05.mkv` + `Other.S01E06.srt`
- Expected: Not matched, no embedding

**Scenario 5: mkvmerge Failure**
- Input: Valid files, but mkvmerge fails (simulated)
- Expected: Original files preserved, clear error message

**Scenario 6: Large File Timeout**
- Input: Large video file (> 500MB)
- Expected: Timeout scaled appropriately

**Scenario 7: Batch Processing**
- Input: 3 video/subtitle pairs
- Expected: All processed, statistics accurate

### File Backup Strategy

**Before Tests:**
1. Copy all files from `integration_testing_files/` to temporary backup
2. Tests modify original files
3. After each test, restore from backup

**After Tests:**
1. Delete temporary backup
2. Verify no leftover files in test directory
3. Restore integration_testing_files/ to original state

### mkvmerge Testing Notes

**When mkvmerge is NOT available:**
- Skip tests that require actual embedding
- Run pattern matching tests (don't need mkvmerge)
- Run validation tests
- Print message: "Some tests skipped - install mkvmerge for full coverage"

**When mkvmerge IS available:**
- Run full integration suite
- Test actual embedding operations
- Verify embedded files are valid

**Installing mkvmerge for Testing:**
- Windows: Download MKVToolNix from official site
- Linux: `sudo apt install mkvtoolnix`
- Mac: `brew install mkvtoolnix`
- Document in test README

### Error Message Validation

**Good Error Messages (Test for these):**
```
[ERROR] Video file not found: path/to/video.mkv
[ERROR] Insufficient disk space. Need 500MB, available 100MB
[ERROR] mkvmerge failed: Invalid subtitle format
[ERROR] Permission denied writing to backups/
```

**Bad Error Messages (Avoid these):**
```
Error occurred
Failed to process
Exception raised
```

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Speed:**
- Pattern matching tests: < 1 second
- Embedding tests (with mkvmerge): 2-5 seconds per file
- Full integration suite: < 30 seconds
- Use small test files to keep tests fast

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Complete workflow validated end-to-end
- ✅ Movie mode tested
- ✅ mkvmerge availability handled gracefully
- ✅ Backup workflow verified
- ✅ Error scenarios tested
- ✅ Rollback behavior validated
- ✅ Tests clean up perfectly
- ✅ Tests run with or without mkvmerge

## Testing

**Test Validation for This Story:**

1. **Without mkvmerge:**
   - Run `python -m unittest tests.test_embedding_integration`
   - Verify pattern matching tests run
   - Verify embedding tests skipped with clear message
   - No errors, just skips

2. **With mkvmerge:**
   - Install mkvmerge if available
   - Run full integration suite
   - Verify all tests run
   - Check execution time < 30 seconds
   - Verify backups created correctly

3. **Cleanup Verification:**
   - Run tests → Check for leftover files
   - Verify `integration_testing_files/` unchanged
   - Verify no `backups/` folder remaining
   - Run tests again → Same result (idempotent)

4. **Error Scenario Testing:**
   - Simulate mkvmerge failure → Rollback works
   - Test with invalid files → Clear error messages
   - Test permission errors → Graceful handling

**Manual Verification:**
- Run `python subfast_embed.py` on test files → Works correctly
- Check backup folder → Originals preserved
- Verify embedded files → Subtitles present
- Test error scenarios manually → Behavior correct
