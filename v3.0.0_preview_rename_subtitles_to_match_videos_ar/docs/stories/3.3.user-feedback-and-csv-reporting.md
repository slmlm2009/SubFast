# Story 3.3: Implement User Feedback and CSV Reporting

## Status
In Progress

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to receive clear feedback during processing and optionally export a detailed report,  
**so that** I can track what was done and troubleshoot any issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **BOTH SCRIPTS:** Display SubFast branded banner at startup (hardcoded ASCII art)
2. Real-time console output shows which file is currently being processed
3. Success/failure status is displayed for each operation
4. The final output filename is displayed after each successful merge
5. A CSV report (`embedding_report.csv`) can be exported with processing details
6. **CRITICAL:** Implement smart console behavior for **BOTH** scripts - renaming AND embedding (if code executed without major exit code, console window automatically closes; if not, it remains active and waits for key input to close)
7. The CSV includes: original filename, subtitle filename, output filename, status, timestamp
8. CSV export is configurable via the `config.ini` file (enabled by default, disabled in case of fall-off)
9. The CSV uses the same structure as the renaming script's `export_analysis_to_csv` function
10. The CSV header includes the SubFast banner (as comments with # prefix)
11. Error details are included in the CSV for failed operations
12. The CSV is saved in the same directory as the processed files
13. A summary is displayed at the top showing total files, successes, failures, and processing time
14. **CRITICAL:** Having a configurable option to have the console window remain open at completion until a key is pressed - this is **shared for BOTH scripts** - renaming AND embedding (disabled by default, will not affect smart console behavior)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 3.2 (Windows Context Menu Integration):**
- Console window appears automatically when scripts are invoked from context menu
- Users expect to see processing progress in real-time
- Console visibility is important for troubleshooting
- Scripts already validate mkvmerge.exe presence on startup
- Integration with Windows Shell requires proper exit codes

**From Story 3.1 (Configuration File Handling):**
- Configuration system is unified across both scripts
- `embedding_report` setting already exists in config.ini (NEW key name)
- Configuration loading includes fallback defaults
- Both scripts share configuration patterns for consistency

### Technical Context

**SubFast Branded Banner:**

**CRITICAL: This banner must appear in BOTH scripts at startup and in CSV headers**

Hardcoded banner constant (add to top of both scripts):
```python
BANNER = """==========================================
   ____        _     _____          _   
  / ___| _   _| |__ |  ___|_ _  ___| |_ 
  \___ \| | | | '_ \| |_ / _` |/ __| __|
   ___) | |_| | |_) |  _| (_| |\__ \ |_ 
  |____/ \__,_|_.__/|_|  \__,_||___/\__|
                                        
   Fast subtitle renaming and embedding

==========================================
"""

CSV_BANNER = """# ==========================================
#    ____        _     _____          _   
#   / ___| _   _| |__ |  ___|_ _  ___| |_ 
#   \___ \| | | | '_ \| |_ / _` |/ __| __|
#    ___) | |_| | |_) |  _| (_| |\__ \ |_ 
#   |____/ \__,_|_.__/|_|  \__,_||___/\__|
#                                         
#    Fast subtitle renaming and embedding
# 
# ==========================================
#
"""

def print_banner():
    """Display SubFast branded banner at startup"""
    print(BANNER)
```

Usage:
- Call `print_banner()` at the very start of `main()` in both scripts
- Use `CSV_BANNER` as the first part of CSV report headers

**🔴 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Smart Console Behavior MUST be IDENTICAL in BOTH Scripts**

This story implements smart console behavior that MUST work exactly the same way in:
1. `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` (embedding script)
2. `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` (renaming script)

Both scripts must:
- Share the same `keep_console_open` config setting from `[General]` section
- Use identical exit code logic
- Implement the same keypress waiting behavior
- Close automatically on success (unless `keep_console_open = true`)
- Stay open on errors for user to see error messages

**Console Output Patterns:**

Current state analysis:
- Embedding script uses `print()` statements with `[INFO]`, `[WARNING]`, `[ERROR]` prefixes
- Configuration loading already provides console feedback
- Need to add per-file processing progress messages
- Summary output should follow established INFO/WARNING/ERROR pattern

[Source: `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` lines 136-346 - existing console output patterns]

**CSV Export Architecture:**

The renaming script already has a comprehensive `export_analysis_to_csv()` function that creates:
- Summary header with timestamp, config, and statistics
- CSV table showing original filenames, detected episodes, and actions
- Match summary showing successful pairings
- Missing matches and unidentified files

The embedding script should follow the same structure:
- Summary section: timestamp, total files, successes, failures, execution time
- Details table: original_video, subtitle_file, output_file, status, error_details (if failed), timestamp
- Configuration summary: mkvmerge path, language code, default_flag setting

[Source: `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` lines 881-1053 - export_analysis_to_csv function]

**Exit Code Handling:**

Python script exit codes (already defined in embedding script):
```python
EXIT_SUCCESS = 0           # All operations completed successfully
EXIT_FATAL_ERROR = 1       # Fatal error: mkvmerge not found, config invalid, etc.
EXIT_PARTIAL_FAILURE = 2   # Some operations failed, some succeeded
EXIT_COMPLETE_FAILURE = 3  # All operations attempted failed
```

[Source: `embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` lines 40-43 - exit codes]

**Smart Console Behavior Logic:**

**CRITICAL: This logic must be IDENTICAL in BOTH renaming AND embedding scripts**

Windows console behavior:
- If script exits with code 0 (success): Console closes automatically
- If script exits with non-zero code: Console remains open showing error
- Additional option: `keep_console_open` config setting to always wait for keypress

Implementation approach (apply to BOTH scripts):
```python
# At end of main():
if exit_code != EXIT_SUCCESS or config.get('keep_console_open', False):
    input("\nPress Enter to close this window...")
sys.exit(exit_code)
```

[Source: Architecture Document §2.1 - Windows Subprocess Execution Guidelines]

**Configuration Settings:**

Already implemented in config.ini:
```ini
[Embedding]
embedding_report = true   # Enable/disable CSV export
```

New setting needed:
```ini
[General]
keep_console_open = false  # Shared between both scripts
```

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/embed_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` - Add CSV export, console feedback, AND smart console behavior
- `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` - Add smart console behavior (same implementation as embedding script)
- `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/config.ini` - Add `keep_console_open` setting to [General] section
- `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/CONFIGURATION_README.md` - Document new settings

**Files Referenced:**
- `rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar/rename_subtitles_to_match_videos_ar.py` - Reference for `export_analysis_to_csv` structure

[Source: Architecture Document §6 - Project Structure]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Test CSV generation with successful operations only
- Test CSV generation with mixed success/failure
- Test CSV generation with all failures
- Test console output formatting
- Test exit code logic (success, partial failure, complete failure)
- Test keep_console_open config setting

**Integration Tests Required:**
- Test CSV export with real file processing
- Test console behavior with different exit codes
- Test configuration loading for new settings
- Verify both scripts share console behavior consistently

[Source: Architecture Document §5 - Testing Strategy]

### Technical Constraints

**Python Standard Library:**
- Use built-in `csv` module for CSV generation
- Use `datetime` module for timestamps (already imported)
- Use `input()` for keypress waiting

**Performance Considerations:**
- CSV writing should not significantly impact processing time
- Console output should be unbuffered for real-time feedback (`flush=True` if needed)

**Compatibility:**
- Must work with Windows 10 and Windows 11
- Console behavior must work when invoked from context menu
- CSV must be UTF-8 encoded to handle international filenames
