nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, reliability, maintainability, usability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Registry modifications require Admin privileges (appropriate). No security vulnerabilities detected. Installation scripts validate files before registry changes.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Context menu integration has negligible performance impact. Scripts execute immediately.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Error handling in INSTALL/UNINSTALL .bat files is appropriate. Registry removal is clean. Scripts work from any installation location.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code organization good (scripts/, bin/, resources/), but cleanup needed. Duplicate folder and misplaced test files reduce clarity.'
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent user experience: auto-elevation, branded installers, 10-second auto-close, clear error messages, location-independent installation.'
