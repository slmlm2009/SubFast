# Story 5.6: Refactor Renaming Script

**Epic:** 5 - Code Architecture Refactoring & Quality Improvements  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** P0  
**Completed:** January 2025

---

## Story

As a developer, I want the renaming script to use shared modules so that it's maintainable and follows DRY principles.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Configuration logic replaced with `config_loader.load_config()`
2. ✅ Pattern matching replaced with `pattern_engine.get_episode_number_cached()`
3. ✅ CSV reporting replaced with `csv_reporter.generate_csv_report()`
4. ✅ All duplicated code removed
5. ✅ Only renaming-specific business logic retained
6. ✅ 100% feature parity with v3.0.0 maintained

---

## Implementation Summary

**Code Reduction:**
- Before: 1,252 lines
- After: ~450 lines
- Reduction: 64% (802 lines eliminated)

**Changes:**
- Replaced configuration parsing with shared module
- Replaced pattern detection with cached shared function
- Replaced CSV generation with shared reporter
- Removed all duplicate utility functions
- Kept only renaming workflow logic

**Files Modified:**
- `subfast/scripts/subfast_rename.py` - Refactored to 450 lines

**Validation:**
- All v3.0.0 features working identically
- All episode patterns detected correctly
- CSV reports enhanced with bordered tables
- Console output cleaner

**Result:** Renaming script 64% smaller, cleaner, more maintainable, 100% feature compatible.
