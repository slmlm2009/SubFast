# Story 5.1: Shared Module Architecture Creation

**Epic:** 5 - Code Architecture Refactoring & Quality Improvements  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** P0  
**Completed:** January 2025

---

## Story

As a developer, I want a shared module architecture so that common functionality can be maintained in one place.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ `scripts/common/` directory structure created
2. ✅ `__init__.py` package initialization file created
3. ✅ Module architecture designed for config, patterns, and reporting
4. ✅ Import strategy defined for both scripts

---

## Implementation Summary

**Deliverables:**
- Created `subfast/scripts/common/` directory
- Added `__init__.py` for Python package
- Established foundation for 3 shared modules:
  - config_loader.py
  - pattern_engine.py
  - csv_reporter.py

**Files Created:**
- `subfast/scripts/common/__init__.py`

**Result:** Foundation established for DRY code architecture eliminating ~1,600 lines of duplication.
