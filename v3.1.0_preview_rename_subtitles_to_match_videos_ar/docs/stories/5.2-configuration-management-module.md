# Story 5.2: Configuration Management Module

**Epic:** 5 - Code Architecture Refactoring & Quality Improvements  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** P0  
**Completed:** January 2025

---

## Story

As a user, I want configuration to be loaded consistently and auto-generated if missing, so that I don't need to manually create config files.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Configuration logic extracted from both scripts
2. ✅ `DEFAULT_CONFIG` dictionary with all settings created
3. ✅ `load_config()` function with auto-generation implemented
4. ✅ Config template with helpful comments generated
5. ✅ Missing config files handled gracefully
6. ✅ Boolean parsing consistent across scripts

---

## Implementation Summary

**Module:** `scripts/common/config_loader.py` (~193 lines)

**Key Features:**
- Auto-generates config.ini on first run with comprehensive template
- Handles missing/corrupted config gracefully (defaults + warnings)
- Validates all settings at startup
- Single source of truth for configuration

**Files Created:**
- `subfast/scripts/common/config_loader.py`

**Result:** Configuration management centralized, auto-generation working, backward compatible with v3.0.0 configs.
