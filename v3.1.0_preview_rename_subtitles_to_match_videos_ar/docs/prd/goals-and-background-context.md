# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Provide Windows users with a fast, automated solution for managing subtitles with their video files
- Eliminate manual, time-consuming subtitle renaming through intelligent pattern matching
- Enable seamless subtitle embedding into MKV videos through right-click context menu integration
- Support all language codes and subtitle formats with configurable options
- Deliver exceptional performance capable of processing 1000+ files in under 1 second
- Maintain simplicity through Windows Explorer integration requiring no GUI or command-line knowledge
- Ensure safe operations through automatic backups and collision handling
- Support batch processing for efficient management of large media libraries

## Background Context

SubFast (formerly "Subtitle Renamer Tool [AR]") has evolved from a simple renaming utility into a comprehensive dual-feature subtitle management system for Windows. The product addresses a critical pain point for media library managers: organizing and integrating subtitles with video files.

**Evolution Context:**
- v1.0.0: Basic episode detection and renaming
- v2.0.0: Windows context menu integration with enhanced pattern recognition
- v2.5.0: Configuration system with 12x performance improvement and 25+ episode patterns
- v3.0.0: Complete rebranding to "SubFast" with new MKV subtitle embedding feature

The v3.0.0 release represents a major milestone, transforming SubFast from a single-purpose renaming tool into a complete subtitle workflow solution. Users previously had to rename subtitles, then manually open GUI applications to embed them - a disconnected, time-consuming process. SubFast now provides a unified, one-click workflow for both operations through Windows Explorer's context menu.
