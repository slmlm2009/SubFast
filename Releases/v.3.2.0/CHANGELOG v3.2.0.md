### Supporting FINAL SEASON Contextual Matching ‚≠ê NEW
**Intelligent season inference for anime final seasons**

#### Problem Solved:
Anime final seasons often released with "FINAL SEASON" in filename but no season number:
```
Subtitle: Boku no Hero Academia FINAL SEASON - 01.ass  (defaults to S01E01)
Video:    My.Hero.Academia.S08E01.mkv                   (actual S08E01)
Result:   NO MATCH ‚ùå (S01 ‚â† S08)
```

#### Solution - Pattern 30:
**Contextual matching with bidirectional season inference**

```
Subtitle: Boku no Hero Academia FINAL SEASON - 01.ass  (inferred from subtitle file S08E01)
Video:    My.Hero.Academia.S08E01.mkv                   (actual S08E01)
Result:   MATCH ‚úÖ
```


#### Bug Fixed and other Enhancements:
**Movie Mode Activation Bug**
- **Issue:** Movie mode activating incorrectly with multiple episode files
- **Fix:** Changed condition to check total files (not remaining)

#### Pattern - {XX} Hardening:
**Enhanced to support OnePiece-style long episode numbers (1000+)**

Pattern 25 now excludes:
- Years (1900-2099) to prevent false matches
- Resolution patterns (720p, 1080p, etc.)
- Codec patterns (x264, x265, AV1, etc.)

```python
# Enhanced regex with negative lookbehind
r'(?<!(?:19|20)\d{2})[\s._-](?P<episode>\d{3,})(?!p)(?!\s*(?:x264|x265|AV1|AAC))'
```

#### Existing Patterns Enhancements:
- **Pattern 1 (S[#]E[#]):** Added VAR4-VAR6 with flexible separators
- **Pattern 4 (S[#]-E[#]):** Added VAR4-VAR5 with underscore separator
- **Pattern 5 (S[#]-EP[#]):** Added VAR4-VAR6 with space variations

#### Pattern Reordering:
**Old Order:** Old original ID assignment (20, 21, 22...)  
**New Order:** By specificity (high to low)

**Reordering Rationale:**
- **High Specificity First:** Patterns with unique markers processed first
- **Prevent False Matches:** More specific patterns capture intent before generic ones


#### Pattern Hardening:
Applied to Patterns 26, 27, 28:
- Episode number range validation (1-9999)
- Season number validation (1-99)
- Prevents year/resolution false matches
